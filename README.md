# Dtassociates Painting and Powerwashing Website

My father is the owner of Dtassociates Painting and although he loves his website I am not it's biggest fan. This project will be my attempt to give his website a new and updated look.

## Background

At this point I've created two projects in Typescript, the first being [FirstBot](https://github.com/shanearcaro/FirstBot) my in-person Among Us discord bot and [AutoAcceptHealthPledge](https://github.com/shanearcaro/AutoAcceptHealthPledge) a very small Firefox extension. Although I am new to Typescript, I have created multiple projects in Javascript, mainly my personal [website](https://www.shanearcaro.com), and feel confident in my ability to overhaul my dad's website.
